# Databricks Migration Tool

This is a migration package to log all Databricks resources for backup and/or migrating to another Databricks workspace.
Migration allows a Databricks organization to move resources between Databricks Workspaces, 
to move between different cloud providers, or to move to different regions / accounts.  

Packaged is based on python 3.6 and DBR 6.x and 7.x releases.  

**Note:** Tools does not support windows currently since path resolution is different than mac / linux.  
Support for Windows is work in progress to update all paths to use pathlib resolution. 

This package uses credentials from the 
[Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/dev-tools/databricks-cli.html)

**DBFS Data Migration:**  
* DBFS is a protected object storage location on AWS and Azure.
* Data within the DBFS bucket can be very large, and the Databricks support team will need to help here. 
  * The Databricks support team has a tool available to help with DBFS migrations between AWS workspaces today. 
  * Azure DBFS migrations is work in progress. 

**Note:** MLFlow objects cannot be exported / imported with this tool.

## Workspace Analysis
Import this [notebook](data/workspace_migration_analysis.py) to do an analysis of the number of objects within the 
current workspace. The last cell will print:
1. Number of users
2. Number of groups
3. Approximate number of notebooks
4. Number of internal jobs defined
5. Number of external jobs executed (from external API invocations)
6. Number of databases
7. Number of tables 

## Order of Operations
1. Export users and groups 
2. Export cluster templates
3. Export notebook metadata (listing of all notebooks)
4. Export notebook content 
5. Export job templates
6. Export Hive Metastore data 

**Note:** During user / group import, users will be notified of the new workspace and account. This is required 
for them to set up their credentials to access the new workspace. We need the user to exist before loading their 
artifacts like notebooks, clusters, etc. 

By default, artifacts are stored in the `logs/` directory, and `azure_logs/` for Azure artifacts. 
This is configurable with the `--set-export-dir` flag to specify the log directory.

While exporting Libraries is supported, we do not have an implementation to import library definitions.

### Users and Groups
This section uses the [SCIM API](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/scim/index.html) to export / import 
user and groups.  
[Instance Profiles API](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/instance-profiles.html) used 
to export instance profiles that are tied to user/group entitlements.   
For AWS users, this section will log the instance profiles used for IAM access to resources. 

To export users / groups, use the following:
```bash
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --users
```

To import these users:
```bash
python import_db.py --profile NEW_DEMO --users
```

If you plan to use this tool to export multiple workspaces, you can set the `--set-export-dir` directory to log 
artifacts into separate logging directories. 


### Clusters
The section uses the [Clusters APIs](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/clusters.html)  

```bash
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --clusters
```
This will export the following:
1. Cluster templates + ACLs
2. Instance pool definitions
3. Cluster policies + ACLs

```bash
python import_db.py --profile NEW_DEMO --clusters
```

### Notebooks
This section uses the [Workspace API](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/workspace.html)

This part is a 3 part process. 
1. Download all notebook locations and paths
2. Download all notebook contents for every path
3. Download all workspace ACLs

```bash
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --workspace
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --download
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --workspace-acls
```

To import into a new workspace:
```bash
python import_db.py --profile NEW_DEMO --workspace [--archive-missing]
python import_db.py --profile NEW_DEMO --workspace-acls 
```
If users have left your organization, their artifacts (notebooks / job templates) still exists. However, their user 
object no longer exists. During the migration, we can keep the old users notebooks into the top level 
directory `/Archive/{username}@domain.com`
Use the `--archive-missing` option to put these artifacts in the archive folder. 

**Single User Export/Import**  
The tool supports exporting single user workspaces using the following command:
```bash
# export a single users workspace
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --export-home example@foobar.com
```

The corollary is the `--import-home` option:
```bash
python import_db.py --profile NEW_DEMO --import-home example@foobar.com
```

### Jobs
This section uses the [Jobs API](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/jobs.html)  
Job ACLs are exported and imported with this option.

```bash
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --jobs
```
If we're unable to find old cluster ids that are no longer available, we'll reset the job template 
to use a new default cluster. 

```bash
python import_db.py --profile NEW_DEMO --jobs
```

Imported jobs into the new workspace are paused by default. We do not want to have 2 jobs run simultaneously. 
Admins must pause their jobs with Databricks defined schedules using the following option:
```bash
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --pause-all-jobs
```

Un-pause all jobs in the new workspace:
```bash
python import_db.py --profile NEW_DEMO --unpause-all-jobs
```

### Hive Metastore
This section uses an API to remotely run Spark commands on a cluster, this API is called 
[Execution Context](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/1.2/index.html#execution-context)

By default, this will launch an small cluster in the `data/` folder to export the Hive Metastore data. 
If you need a specific IAM role to export the metastore, use the `--cluster-name` option to connect to 
a specific cluster. 

By default, we will edit the cluster for every defined IAM role to loop through all failed exports in case the tool was 
missing IAM permissions. To disable looping through all failed exports, you can pass in `--skip-failed`

```bash
# export all metastore entries and brute force loop through all instance profiles / IAM roles
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --metastore

# export all metastore entries on the default cluster without retries
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --metastore --skip-failed 

# export all metastore entries on a specific cluster
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --metastore --cluster-name "Test"

# export all tables within a specific database
python export_db.py --profile DEMO --metastore --cluster-name "Test" --database "my_db"
```

To find legacy Hive tables that need to be repaired after a successful import, run the following:
```
python import_db.py --profile DST --get-repair-log
```
Once completed, it will upload a log to the destination location. 
Use this [repair notebook](data/repair_tables_for_migration.py) to import into the destination environment to repair 
all tables. 

### Export Groups by Name
This functionality exports group(s), their members, and corresponding notebooks.  
This assumes an empty export directory to simplify the number of operations needed.  
This does **not** include IAM roles as those likely change while moving across workspaces. 

```bash
# reset the export directory and export a set of groups
python export_db.py --reset-export && python export_db.py --profile SRC --export-groups 'groupA,groupB'

# import the groups that were exported
python import_db.py --profile DST --import-groups
```

### Export / Import Top Level Notebooks
This will export all notebooks that are not a part of the `/Users/` directories to help migrate notebooks that are 
outside of personal workspace directories. 
```bash
# reset the export directory and export the top level directories / notebooks
python export_db.py --reset-export && python export_db.py --profile SRC --workspace-top-level-only
# if ACLs are enabled, export the ACLs as well
python export_db.py --profile SRC --workspace-acls

# import the groups that were exported
python import_db.py --profile DST --workspace-top-level
# apply acls if needed 
python import_db.py --profile DST --workspace-acls
```

#### FAQs / Limitations
**Note**: To disable ssl verification pass the flag `--no-ssl-verification`.
If still getting SSL Error add the following to your current bash shell -
```
export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=""
export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=""
```

Limitations:
* Instance profiles (AWS only): Group access to instance profiles will take precedence. If a user is added to the role 
directly, and has access via a group, only the group access will be granted during a migration.  
* Clusters: Cluster creator will be seen as the single admin user who migrated all the clusters. (Relevant for billing 
purposes)
  * Cluster creator tags cannot be updated. Added a custom tag named `OriginalCreator` with the original cluster creator
   for DBU tracking.
* Jobs: Job owners will be seen as the single admin user who migrate the job configurations. (Relevant for billing 
purposes)
  * Jobs with existing clusters that no longer exist will be reset to the default cluster type
  * Jobs with older legacy instances will fail with unsupported DBR or instance types. See release notes for the latest
   supported releases.
